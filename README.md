I spent most of this week working on school projects and trying to create a healthier lifestyle. The biggest challenge I faced this week was getting back into the habit of exercising regularly. My largest success came from the completion of my non-objective drawing in my drawing course (as well as just getting through all my other coursework). It wasn't the most eventful week, but there are definetly more interesting challenges and successes to come.
