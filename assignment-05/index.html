            The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle

            In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf.

            One Sunday morning the warm sun came up and - pop! - out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry Caterpillar.

            He started to look for some food. I’m so HUNGRY!

            1 cupcake,
